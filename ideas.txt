# Playlist Feature Ideas

## High priority

1. Confirmation dialog for delete - Currently playlist deletion is immediate with no confirmation
2. Drop position indicator - Show a visual line where items will be inserted when reordering
3. Duplicate prevention - Prevent adding the same track/video to a playlist twice
4. Batch remove - Allow removing multiple selected items at once (currently only one at a time via context menu)

## Medium priority

5. Playlist item count - Show track count next to each playlist in the sidebar (e.g., "My Playlist (12)")
6. Empty state message - Show helpful text when a playlist is empty
7. Keyboard shortcuts - Delete key to remove selected items, F2 to rename playlist

## Nice to have

8. Drag count indicator - Show how many items are being dragged (e.g., "3 items")
9. Copy/duplicate playlist - Right-click option to duplicate a playlist
10. Total duration - Show total playlist duration in the header
